# Olical's dotfiles

This is designed to be run within Arch Linux, I use `archinstall` to set everything up then clone this repo, install the packages and use the stow script to link all of the config.

## Usage

Clone this repo somewhere neat, such as `~/repos/Olical/dotfiles`, `cd` into the directory and execute `script/bootstrap.sh`. This will install all essential packages (as well as a few non-essential but useful ones) and then switch the terminal and shell over.

Your mileage may vary wildly, this is built for me and may break your entire machine. Be careful, read the code and just take the lines and files you're interested in if you can.

## License

Consider dotfiles unlicensed (https://unlicense.org/), do what you want with anything you want. Feel free to link back if you want, it could help others in the future but I don't mind otherwise.

## Questions?

Feel free to open issues if you're interested in something or toot me https://mastodon.social/@Olical
