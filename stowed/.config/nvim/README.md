# Neovim configuration in Fennel

My new 2025 Neovim configuration in Fennel, compiled by [nfnl][].

I'm skimming [awesome-neovim][] to find all the things I need.

## To Do

 - [x] Plugin manager (lazy)
 - [x] Fennel compiler + bootstrap mostly in Fennel (nfnl)
 - [x] Directory browser and editor (oil)
 - [ ] Fuzzy search
 - [ ] Key hints
 - [ ] Tree Sitter
 - [ ] LSP
 - [ ] Status line / clean and helpful UI elements
 - [ ] Colour scheme
 - [ ] AI
 - [ ] Git (probably just lazygit)
 - [ ] Sessions
 - [ ] REPL (Conjure!)
 - [ ] Buffer navigation, leap/easymotion etc
 - [ ] Completion
