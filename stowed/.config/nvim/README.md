# Neovim configuration in Fennel

My new 2025 Neovim configuration in Fennel, compiled by [nfnl][].

I'm skimming [awesome-neovim][] to find all the things I need.

## To Do

 - [x] Plugin manager (lazy)
 - [x] Fennel compiler + bootstrap mostly in Fennel (nfnl)
 - [x] Directory browser and editor (oil)
 - [x] Colour scheme (onedark)
 - [x] Notification system (mini.notify)
 - [x] Status line / clean and helpful UI elements (lualine)
 - [x] Key hints + pneumonic and handy mappings (jk, leader+q)
 - [x] Fuzzy search
 - [x] Brace and quote matching (nvim-autopairs)
 - [x] Sexpression editing (paredit, need to check keys)
 - [x] Buffer navigation (flash, needs some tweaking and reading)
 - [x] Tree Sitter
 - [ ] Completion
 - [ ] LSP
 - [ ] Linting / warning tool if LSP isn't always good enough
 - [ ] Spelling
 - [ ] Persistent undo tree + UI
 - [ ] AI
 - [ ] Git (probably just lazygit)
 - [ ] Sessions
 - [ ] REPL (Conjure!)

 ## Quirks

 - [ ] Why does statusline flash on every oil buffer?
